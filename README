pyrandomprojection
------------------

    by Joseph Turian

Random projection library for Python, converting a dictionary to
low-dimensional numpy vector

"Random projection is a simple geometric technique for reducing
the dimensionality of a set of points in Euclidean space while
preserving pairwise distances approximately" -Santosh Vempala
<http://www-math.mit.edu/~vempala/rp.html>

    http://github.com/turian/random-indexing-wordrepresentations
A more end-to-end package (rather than drop-in function) for specifically
inducing word representations over a corpus, using random indexing
(a specific application of random projection).

WARNING:
    * This is random access to an RNG. Instead of using a pseudo-RNG as
    such (which might be slow), or caching the random matrix (which might
    take a lot of memory), we use hashing to provide no-memory random
    access to random numbers. I can't promise that this hashing provides
    "strong" random numbers.

    * We use Murmur, a Python-wrapped C implementation of murmurhash. This
    is probably not the latest or most bugfixed implementation of
    MurmurHash 2.0.


TODO:
    Need test suite to make sure that values are consistent across
    architectures.

REQUIREMENTS:
    * numpy
        Output is put in a (dense) numpy vector

    * Murmur:
        easy_install murmur
        http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Murmur/
        Provides fast murmur hashes for strings, files, and ziped files.
